a=[1, 2, 3, 4]

b.append(a);
b.append(a);

print(b);
print(b[0][0]);

now this will show the output as:

[[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]]

Now, the concept is same as C/C++ matrices, just a lot simpler now, because
we can actually visualize the 2d matrices.

so the b is a 2d list, that contains 2 elements which are basically two lists.

the 0th element is the first list([1, 2, 3, 4]) and the 1st element is
the second list([1, 2, 3, 4]);

now, when you write b[0][0], this basically means that you want to access the 0th element of the 0th list(i.e [1, 2, 3, 4])

so, b[0][0]
      |  |____________> this indicates the index of the element in the required list that we are trying to access!!
      v
      this indicates the index of the list that we are trying to access
