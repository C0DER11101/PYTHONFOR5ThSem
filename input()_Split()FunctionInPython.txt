a=input().split();
print(a);

this basically gets as many inputs as possible in the same line and makes
a list of those inputs but those inputs are taken as string by default.
So the output of the above print(a) is a list containing all the inputs
provided by the user.

b=[int(j) for j in input().split()]

the outer square brackets are provided for int(j) part, actually here we are
typcasting the input provided by the user to integer(it's string by default).
Don't get confused, b=[int(j) for  j in input().split()] doesnot create a list of lists(just because there is an outer square bracket [int(j)....]).

first we have typecasted j into int and then we have taken input from the
user.

Also remember one thing:

when you want to append multiple inputs to a list, use the split() function like this:

a=[]

a.append([int(j) for j in input().split()]);

OR IF YOU WANT STRING INPUTS:

a.append([str(j) for j in input().split()]);
