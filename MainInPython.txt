if __name__=="__main__":
	#code

this statement checks whether the python interpreter is running the current python file as main or not, which the interpreter will obviously
run as main file so if __name__=="__main__" will evaluate to true!!


This if statement evaluates to true only if the file is run without importing it into other programs.
If it's imported in other programs and run, then its if __name__=="__main__" condition evaluates to false!!
