# Merge Sort in Python!!

_Before we begin, let's just break the name "Merge Sort" and find out what it really means in terms of algorithms!!_

**Merge**: This means that you have to perform merge sort on the array(single array).
**Sort**: This means that you have to perform sorting on the array.

But before performing merging and sorting, you need to divide the array into two equal parts repeatedly until you get single
elements which cannot be further divided!!

Now, after that, we perform the merging of elements.

**Remember, when you divide the array into two equal parts, you need to consider them as two different arrays!!!**
