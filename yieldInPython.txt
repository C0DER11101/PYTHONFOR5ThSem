						THE YIELD KEYWORD


What the yield keyword do:

>Yield keyword is used to create a generator function. A type of function that is memory efficient and can be used like an iterator 
object.

The main difference between yield and return keyword is, the return statement terminates the execution of the function.
Whereas, the yield statement only pauses the execution of the function(and then resumes it afterwards).


The yield keyword will turn any expression that is given with it into a generator object and return it to the caller.
Therefore, you must iterate over the generator object if you wish to obtain the values stored there. 
We will see the yield python example.
